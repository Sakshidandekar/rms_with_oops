This is a Python-based Restaurant Management System built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system is designed to help manage various aspects of restaurant operations, such as menu management, order processing, and Billing process, in a more organized and modular way using classes and objects.

Features:-
1. Menu Management: Add, remove, or update menu items.
2. Order Management: Track and manage customer orders.
3. Billing System: Automatically generate and calculate bills based on the customer's orders.
4. Paymetn Verification : Typically deals with confirming that the payment made by the customer is valid and processed correctly. This feature is important to ensure that the customer is charged correctly and the system reflects the correct transaction status.

Classes Overview:-
The system is designed using OOP principles, with key classes that define the core functionality of the application. Here are some of the primary classes:
1. Menu Item: Represents each item on the restaurant's menu (name, description, price).
2. Order: Represents a customer order, including the items ordered, quantities, and the order total.
3. Restaurant: The main class that handles the entire restaurant system, including order processing, billing, and menu management.
